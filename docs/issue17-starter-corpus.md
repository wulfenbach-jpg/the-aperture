# Issue 17 — supported starter corpus

Status: **PARTIAL**. One starter package is implemented and exercised; the
eight-list release gate in the public issue remains open. Only
`jasmine-vanilla-stompy` is supported. Every other entry below is a **planned**
archetype with an exact sourced **desired** list under
`decks/starter-corpus/planned/`, and **no** claimed card support, playability or
certification.

The machine-readable target list is
`decks/starter-corpus/manifest.json` (schema `version: 1`). Its `status` field is
`planned`, `implemented` or `certified`; planned entries have a non-null
`deck_path` pointing at their exact desired 99-card library, but remain
engine-unsupported and non-playable. `deck_path` is not a support claim.

## Target archetypes

| id | commander | style | status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `isamaru-white-aggro` | Isamaru, Hound of Konda | white aggressive one-drop | planned |
| `jasmine-vanilla-stompy` | Jasmine Boreal | green/white vanilla-creature stompy | implemented |
| `talrand-draw-go` | Talrand, Sky Summoner | blue draw-go spells-matter | planned |
| `krenko-goblin-tokens` | Krenko, Mob Boss | red goblin token swarm | planned |
| `ayula-bear-counters` | Ayula, Queen Among Bears | green bear tribal +1/+1 counters | planned |
| `elas-sacrifice` | Elas il-Kor, Sadistic Pilgrim | white/black sacrifice/drain | planned |
| `tatyova-landfall` | Tatyova, Benthic Druid | green/blue landfall value | planned |
| `zada-spells` | Zada, Hedron Grinder | red single-target spell copying | planned |

All eight entries now have an exact desired 99-card library file. Only Jasmine's
is supported and playable; the other seven are **planned metadata**, never
supported defaults. Their `deck_path` points under
`decks/starter-corpus/planned/`, and their cards are mostly outside the current
79-card pool. Isamaru itself is supported, but none of its 57 chosen nonland
cards is, so `isamaru-white-aggro` stays `planned`.

## Corpus union and staged gaps

Computed from the exact files and the current catalog:

* union of all nonbasic names across the eight lists: **447 unique cards**;
* **61** of them are in the supported pool and **386** are missing;
* per planned list: 57 unique nonland names + 42 basics = 99; Jasmine has 58
  nonland + 41 basics = 99.
* Supported overlap by desired list: Jasmine 58/58, Ayula 6/57, Talrand 3/57,
  Isamaru/Krenko/Elas/Tatyova/Zada 0/57. Missing counts in the manifest are
  computed from catalog membership, including the unsupported **Swamp** basic
  in Elas (the pool has no black basic land).

Staged interaction roadmap (derived from the manifest `missing_interactions`):

1. tokens and token permanents (Talrand, Krenko, Ayula, Zada);
2. triggered abilities, especially spell-cast, landfall, death and tribal
   triggers (Talrand, Elas, Tatyova, Ayula);
3. activated non-mana abilities and sacrifice outlets (Krenko, Elas);
4. keyword semantics (haste for Krenko);
5. counters as rules objects (Ayula);
6. single-target spell copying and go-wide pump (Zada);
7. legend rule, equipment and Aura permanents (Isamaru and any future legend);
8. black basic land support (Elas).

A further count gap: the current pool has no black basic land, so Elas cannot
be constructed even as a legal 99-card practice library until `Swamp` is added.
None of these planned lists is called supported, legal-for-play or certified.

## First implemented package: jasmine-vanilla-stompy

* Commander: **Jasmine Boreal** — `{3}{G}{W}`, legendary 4/5 Human with no rules
  text. It is a genuine printed vanilla legend and is registered in the typed
  `CardId::SUPPORTED_COMMANDERS` allow-list next to Isamaru.
* Library: **99 cards** in
  `decks/starter-corpus/jasmine-vanilla-stompy.txt`, commander supplied
  separately:
  * **58 unique nonland cards**, all singleton, all supported: 47 newly sourced
    vanilla green/white creatures, 11 previously supported green/white
    nonland cards (four vanilla creatures, four instants, three creatures with
    already-tested typed abilities);
  * **41 basic lands**: 20 Plains and 21 Forest.
* Total with the commander: 100 cards. No card in the library is legendary, so
  the unimplemented legend rule is never exercised. No nonbasic singleton card
  is duplicated. There is no snow, artifact, enchantment creature, token,
  counter, keyword or unsupported rules text in the package.
* Sourced printings: `fixtures/starter-corpus/sourced-cards.json` records the
  concrete Scryfall printing, printing URL, Oracle fields and retrieval time for
  every referenced card. Raw provider responses are in
  `evidence/issue17/scryfall-responses.json`.
* Offline analyzer snapshots: `fixtures/starter-corpus/` contains the
  `aperture.commander-deck.v1` list snapshot, the
  `aperture.card-metadata.v1` card snapshot and a fixture manifest with the
  bound SHA-256 digests. These use the existing `commander-check` analyzer; no
  parallel legality engine was added.

Reproduce the source capture and snapshots:

```
python evidence/issue17/source-starter-cards.py
python evidence/issue17/generate-starter-fixtures.py
cargo run -p aperture-cli -- commander-check \
  --deck fixtures/starter-corpus/jasmine-vanilla-stompy.deck.json \
  --cards fixtures/starter-corpus/jasmine-vanilla-stompy.cards.json --json
```

The analyzer reports format legality `legal`, one commander, 99 library cards,
100 total, 61 unique canonical names and engine support `supported`. Its
`gameplay.available` field remains `false` with the pre-existing blanket reasons;
that refusal was deliberately not relaxed. Bounded command-zone and
Commander-combat practice are still **not** the Commander format.

## Phased gaps (why the eight-list gate is open)

1. **Card-support surface.** The implemented pool is 79 cards. Non-vanilla
   archetypes need token creation, activated abilities beyond land mana,
   triggered abilities, keyword semantics, counters as rules objects and
   static/layer effects that this slice does not implement. Those are the
   `missing_interactions` entries in the manifest.
2. **Commanders.** Six target commanders are not in the supported pool.
   Extending the typed registry is deliberately explicit: adding a name to
   `SUPPORTED_COMMANDERS` without implementing its printed text would fake
   support.
3. **Exact lists.** Every planned target has an exact sourced desired list under
   `decks/starter-corpus/planned/`, and its `deck_path` points at it. Jasmine's
   implemented list is directly under `decks/starter-corpus/`.
   A desired-list path is a planning artifact, not support: every planned list is
   engine-unsupported, non-playable and non-certified. Jasmine is the only list
   built entirely from supported cards. A 90-land pile or duplicated nonbasic
   singleton cards would not be a meaningful style and is not used to satisfy
   counts.
4. **Certification.** `implemented` means an exact list exists, is analyzer
   legal/supported and has played an exact four-seat bounded game. It does not
   mean eight-list certification, independent review or merged CI.

## Exclusion policy

* Only cards whose complete printed text maps to implemented engine semantics
  may enter the catalog. Unsupported text means the card is refused, never
  approximated.
* Genuine vanilla creatures are preferred for volume: they add no hidden
  keyword, token, counter or replacement semantics.
* Legendary cards are commander-only. The legend rule is not modelled, so a
  supported commander is refused in ordinary starting libraries and no other
  legend may enter a starter library.
* Nonbasic singleton cards may appear once per list. Basic lands are the only
  repeatable cards.
* Source data must come from an authoritative printing (Scryfall printing
  endpoint or official Gatherer) with a retrieval date. No card name, cost,
  type line, power/toughness or Oracle text is authored by hand.
* Format legality, engine support and actual gameplay support are reported
  separately. A legal/supported list is still not Commander format gameplay.

## Practical limitations

* The game/replay journey is a local 2–4-seat deterministic heuristic run under
  the explicit bounded 40-life Commander-combat practice profile; it is not
  networked multiplayer or full Commander.
* The AI is the existing deterministic heuristic. This package adds no
  strategy tuning.
* The native UI's bundled table still defaults to the practice decks; the
  starter corpus is exercised through the CLI with explicit deck paths.
